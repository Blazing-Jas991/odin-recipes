    <h1>Baby Back Ribs</h1>
    <a href="../index.html">Home</a>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These slow cooker ribs are the best — they turn out perfect every time! They cook in a crockpot until tender, then are covered<br></br> with barbeque sauce and finished in the oven for fall-apart ribs. Perfect for during the week as the slow cooker does most of the work!</p>
